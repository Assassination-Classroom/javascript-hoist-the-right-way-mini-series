# The Goal:

<div style="text-align:center"><img alt="Back to the Glory" src="./assets/back_to_the_glory.png" width="500"></div>

Everything began from this simple yet thinkable question: `Why learning new kinds of stuff is so irritating and annoying?!`
JS `Assassination Classroom` goal is `JavaScript` and `TypeScript` learning in a `fun` and of course `modern way`. This package currently includes a `manga mini-series` but we intend to create `mini animes` and even `fun games`. So, **Assassination Classroom: Javascript Hoist The Right Way Mini-Series** `is just the beginning`. The beginning of the way must be passed, considering `new generations of developers` are joining the market and striving to become `pro`.
So, it's only natural for us to update our way of learning so they can find it attractive. We believe it's the only way we could pass valuable treasure of software development techniques upon our succeeders. As we already said, it's only natural and legit to use fun, as nothing gonna replace it.

> `It's the main reason we decided to make the hard and annoying time of learning into interesting fun`.

We are very excited to devote our precious time to this idea, hope you find it exciting. too.

Best regards.
